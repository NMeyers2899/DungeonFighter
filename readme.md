## How to Play
Dungeon Fighter is a small proof-of-concept design that sets the player within a void and sets the player to face off against a number of enemies. Manuver your ship around obstacles and take down bloodthirsty enemies to achieve victory!
### Controls
WASD - Move your character.

Arrow Keys - Rotates your character to have them look in a specific direction (independent of where you are moving).

F - Fires a projectile (press and hold to achieve a charge shot which does more damage, hits in a wider area, and shoots farther).

Q - Pulls up a shield for a short period of time.

1 - Allows you to enter the game (on the start menu).

2 - Allows you to quit the game (on the start menu).

ESC - Allows you to exit the application.
### Enemies
Some tips when it comes to the enemies you will face in the game.

Basic Enemy - This enemy simply follows the player through the arena. A single projectile is all you need.

Geist - Unaffected by your projectiles and walls. Will fire its own projectile at you and can have that projectile deflected back at it.

Mothership -  Moves back and forth along the bottom of the battlefield. It will spawn smaller versions of the basic enemy over time.

Guardian - With the help of its drones, it is heavily protected from your projectiles. Strike down the drones to strike down the guardian!
